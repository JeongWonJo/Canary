# Canary
Assistant IoT for the Visually Impaired

Canary is a smart guide clip for the visually-impaired, which helps meet their social needs by removing the standard canes and thus increasing connectivity between the tactile pavement and the user, and the user and the society.

Canary will widen the spectrum of assist devices for white cane users, and increase accessibility to the benefits of IT for the visually-impaired in general.
